% Establish a presidence 
Personal computers have been developed to a point where those unfamiliar with computer science theory might conclude there is nothing computers cannot do.
While this is an understandable conclusion, it has been proven that there is a limit to the types of computation our ``classical computers", what we today consider general purpose computers, can perform \cite{linz}.
In the last few decades however, the field of quantum mechanics and quantum computing have advanced to the point where primitive operations are now possible in the quantum sphere.
Just this year Google claimed to acheive ``quantum supremacy" in an experiment in which they performed a computation, using a quantum computer, in under five minutes. 
Google estimated that the same computation would take a state-of-the-art super computer 10,000 years to complete \cite{quantum_supremacy}. 
While quantum computers are not general purpose, they can solve NP-Hard and exponentially complex problems in polynomial time or better \cite{TODO}.
This breakthrough in computability will change the way information is stored, secured, and created.


% State the problem
Currently, encryption protocols ensure the integrity of data and identities are trusted.
One such protocol is the the widly adopted Diffe-Hellman protocol, which relies on the historic difficulty of factoring large prime numbers for security \cite{qc:agi}.
The protocol works by using a public and private key pair for each participating party.
Data encrypted using a key (usually a public key) can then be decrypted using the private key.
For example, a person's public and private keys are mathematically related to their private key, and it requires factoring large prime number to derive the private ky from the public key, which is comutationally infeasible with a classical computer.
Quantum computers however, are able to do this in only polynomial time complexity \cite{doi:10.1137/S0036144598347011}.
This development, combined with the growing power of quantum computers, gives rise to security concerns to the Diffe-Hellman protocol in the future.

% Mention the solution
One such development was the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol.
There are many encryption protocols in use today, such as the Diffe-Hellman key exchange protocol (KEP), each of which provide their own various security measures.
The BB84 protocol allows two parties to co-generate a disposable encryption key which can be used once to encrypt then decrypt data, and be discarded after use.
This type of key is known as a one-time-pad, and it gets its security from being disposable; data patterns are harder to identify the fewer times data is encrypted using a key \cite{TODO}.
The BB84 protocol allows for detection of an eavesdropper durring key generation, allowing both parties to abort the key generation process before any encrypted messages are transmitted \cite{qcftgu}.
This thesis presents a peer to peer simulation of the BB84 quantum quantum KEP, and serves as an introduction to programming in the quantum computing paradigm using simulaqron, a quantum network simulator \cite{simulaqron}.
