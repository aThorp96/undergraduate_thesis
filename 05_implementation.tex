There are already some quantum computers available to the public in the form of an API, however fully featured quantum computers a


% Discuss simulaqron
The BB84 Simulator was written on top of the Simulaqron Python library.
Simulaqron is a quantum network simulation library that allows the programmer to define networks and have client programs manipulate and exchange simulated qubits \cite{simulaqron}.
An instance of Simulaqron acts as a quantum server in the simulator.
It serves as both the public quantum channel and the quantum computer that creates and distributes the qubits to each party.
