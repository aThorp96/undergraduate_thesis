% Describe what we need to understand to move forward
In order to properly discuss the BB84 quantum KEP one must first understand some basic principals and terminology of encryption and quantum computation. 
This foundation will allow us to critically analyze and understand the properties and intricacies of the protocol.

\section{Encryption}
% Asymmetric encryption
% Diffe Hellman in depth
% DH Weaknesses

% Symmetric Encryption
% One Time Pad in depth
% One Time Pad caveats

% True random number generation

\section{Quantum Computation}

% Basic properties
%	State
%	Measurement
%	BasesS
% 	Entanglement
%	TODO: Figure out what else is needed to understand this protocol
%
% Guarantees
% 	Copy-ability
