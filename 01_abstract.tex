The ISO C++ Standard standard does not specify the storage size or binary representation used for floating-point types. This ambiguity creates difficulties when a developer wishes to serialize floating-point values using a binary format that allows them to be successfully de-serialized on a variety of other systems. The most commonly used standard for floating-point values is the IEEE-754 Standard for Binary Floating-Point. However, this standard does not strictly define all aspects of its implementation. This means that even when the IEEE-754 standard is used, floating-point values can not be reliably serialized on one system that implements the standard and de-serialized on a different system implementing the same standard. Attempting to serialize values on an IEEE-754 system and de-serialize them on a non IEEE-754 (or the inverse) is a more significant challenge. This thesis presents a framework that may be used to serialize floating-point values to a standardized format and de-serialize those values on a variety of platforms. The framework is also placed through testing in order to show its viability.
